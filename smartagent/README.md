# 🤖 SmartAgent

**Your personal AI agent with decentralized inference you own.**

SmartAgent gives you a personal AI assistant that works out of the box — no API key, no subscription, no corporate middleman. Powered by [OpenClaw](https://openclaw.ai) and [Morpheus](https://mor.org) decentralized inference.

> **New: [DIY Setup Guide](https://github.com/SmartAgentProtocol/Mac-Mini-Morpheus-Agent-DIY-Guide)** — Want to build a Smart Agent from scratch on a Mac mini? Complete walkthrough with identity separation, on-chain guardrails, three-tier inference fallback, and 8 documented gotchas. Every step tested on real hardware.

## Install

One command:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://smartagent.org/install.sh | bash
```

That's it. The installer handles everything:

1. ✅ Installs Node.js (if needed)
2. ✅ Installs OpenClaw (the AI agent framework)
3. ✅ Installs [Everclaw](https://everclaw.xyz) (decentralized inference)
4. ✅ Bootstraps decentralized inference via Morpheus API Gateway
5. ✅ Configures your agent with sensible defaults
6. ✅ Opens WebChat in your browser — start talking immediately

**No API key required.** Decentralized inference from the Morpheus network.

## What You Get

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Inference You Own** | Powered by Morpheus P2P network — no subscription needed |
| **Personal agent** | Remembers you across sessions, learns your preferences |
| **Private** | Runs locally on your machine, no data harvesting |

## Upgrade Path

SmartAgent grows with you:

```
Day 1:   Morpheus API Gateway (Kimi K2.5, GLM-5, MiniMax M2.5, open access)
           ↓
Week 1:  Own API key from app.mor.org (personalized, no cost)
           ↓
Month 1: Venice subscription ($8/mo → Claude, GPT-5.2)
           ↓
Later:   MOR staking → own your inference forever
```

## How It Works

SmartAgent = **OpenClaw** + **Everclaw** + **pre-configured defaults**

- [**OpenClaw**](https://openclaw.ai) is the MIT-licensed AI agent framework — handles sessions, memory, tools, channels, and the agent runtime
- [**Everclaw**](https://everclaw.xyz) connects your agent to the Morpheus decentralized inference network — no API key needed to start
- **SmartAgent** bundles them together with a one-line installer and configuration tuned for new users

## Requirements

- **macOS 12+** or **Linux** (x86_64 or arm64)
- ~500MB disk space
- Internet connection

## Commands

After installation:

| Action | Command |
|--------|---------|
| Start agent | `openclaw gateway start` |
| Stop agent | `openclaw gateway stop` |
| Open WebChat | `openclaw webchat` |
| View logs | `openclaw gateway logs` |
| Check status | `openclaw status` |
| Update OpenClaw | `openclaw update` |
| Update Everclaw | `cd ~/.openclaw/workspace/skills/everclaw && git pull` |
| **Diagnose** | `bash ~/.openclaw/workspace/skills/everclaw/scripts/diagnose.sh` |
