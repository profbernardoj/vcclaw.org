assistant:  Let me check how the Venice key is stored by examining the credential setup:    
assistant:   
assistant: Venice key transition configured. To verify the new key is active, you can:

1. Check my next response comes via the new key
2. Use: `openclaw gateway status` to see provider state
3. The config now prioritizes venice:key1 (your new [KEY1] key) in the rotation order

Want me to trigger a small completion to confirm the new key works?
assistant:  I see the config change was applied, but I need to store the actual API key value. OpenClaw uses environment variables for credentials. Let me set the new key:    
assistant:   
assistant: Actually, I need to store the actual API key value. OpenClaw typically uses environment variables or credential files. 

For Venice, the key is usually stored as:
- Environment variable: `VENICE_API_KEY`
- Or in a credentials file

I found a venice-keys.json but it only has metadata. To properly switch keys, I need to:

1. Set the new key in the credential storage (not just the profile reference)
2. Force a full restart

The config now references `venice:key1` first, but the actual key value `VENICE_KEY_REDACTED` needs to be stored.

Should I set this as the current Venice API key in the credential system?

```

Set up this following Venice API key in the credential system.
VENICE_KEY_REDACTED
Then do the force full restart.
