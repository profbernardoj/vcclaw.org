Unfortunately the response still shows activity on the old key.
So check again and try again to switch and restart and see if the config gets picked up after the re-start.
assistant: The config file has the new key, but the auth order shows `venice:default` first, then `venice:key1`. The auth profiles likely have separate stored credentials. Let me check where those are kept:
assistant: There it is — auth profiles are stored separately per agent. The `auth.order` puts `venice:default` first, and that profile likely still has the old key. Let me check:
assistant: The issue is clear. The `auth.order` puts `venice:default` first — that profile has the OLD key stored separately from `openclaw.json`. The `apiKey` in the config file was updated but OpenClaw uses the auth profile system for actual credentials, not the config file key. Let me update the auth profile directly:
assistant: The interactive prompt accepted the key. Let me check if it completed:
assistant: Found it. The auth-profiles are at agent level and the `main` agent must store them somewhere. The key format is `VENICE-INFERENCE-KEY-...` (dashes not underscores). Let me find the main agent's auth-profiles and update ALL of them:
assistant: Now I see the full picture. ALL auth-profiles across ALL 14 agents still have the old keys. The `venice:default` and `venice:key1` both point to the old `[KEY1]...` key. The config file apiKey was updated but auth-profiles.json files are the actual credential store. Let me update all of them:
assistant: All 15 auth-profiles updated. Now restart the gateway to pick up the new credentials:
assistant: Found the problem. The `config.patch` only updated the `apiKey` field in `openclaw.json`, but OpenClaw uses separate `auth-profiles.json` files per agent as the actual credential store. All 15 agents still had the old key (`[KEY1]...`).

Fixed now — updated all 15 `auth-profiles.json` files across every agent (main, all project agents, all pipeline agents) to the new key. Gateway restarting. Try me again after it comes back up.

}
```

Figure it out?
assistant: Yeah — the issue was that `config.patch` only updates the `apiKey` in `openclaw.json`, but OpenClaw actually reads credentials from `auth-profiles.json` files stored per agent. All 15 agents had the old key hardcoded there.

Updated all 15 auth-profiles and restarted. I'm live now — check your Venice dashboard and see if this response hit the new key.

Thanks.
assistant: 👍 Good lesson on the key rotation — I'll remember that auth-profiles are the real credential store, not the config apiKey. Logged it for next time.

Great. Now run a session archiving skill. So we can bring the context back down.
I'm going to start a new session.
assistant: Done. Cleaned up ~2.9MB of index bloat across 8 agents, swept 50 junk files, and compressed 1 tarball. Ready for a fresh session.
