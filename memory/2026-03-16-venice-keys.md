## Conversation Summary

assistant: Now I see the full picture:

**Findings:**

1. **Venice config fixed** - Key was set as env var name `VENICE_INFERENCE_KEY_[KEY2]...` instead of actual key value. Patched to `[KEY2]...`

2. **Key1 ([KEY1])status** - Was disabled on Mar 11 due to 402 (exhausted DIEM). Both keys return "Not found" on the balance endpoint (API may not support that endpoint).

3. **"gateway failed: raw required"** - This is a`gateway` tool call error, not a Venice API issue. It happened when I called `gateway config.patch` without the `raw` parameter earlier.

Let me clear the disabled state for key1 and verify both keys work now:
assistant: Both keys fail on actual completions. Let me check if there's a different issue:
assistant: Interesting - the models endpoint works but completions fail. This suggests the keys may have **exhausted DIEM balance**. Venice allows listing models but rejects completions when balance is zero.

Let me check the Venice DIEM balance properly:
assistant: I see - the auth profiles don't have API keys set! Let me check the full auth config:
assistant: The config looks correct now. The issue is that **both Venice API keys are returning 401 Authentication Failed** on completions, even though they work for the models list endpoint.

This indicates the keys have **exhausted DIEM balance**. Venice allows listing models (read-only) but rejects completions when balance is zero.

Let me check the historical DIEM balances:
assistant: **Found it!** The logs show Venice key1 ran out of DIEM:
- Mar 15 12:14: key1 at **0.188 DIEM** (nearly exhausted)
- Feb 22: Multiple 402 "Insufficient USD or Diem balance" errors

But I just configured key2. Let me verify the config actually has the right key andtest it:
assistant: Both Venicekeys are returning 401 on completions. Let me check the Guardian logs for key2'sDIEM balance:
assistant: Found it! The logs show:
- **key2 ([KEY2])**: "persistent 401 (known pre-existing since Feb 26 rotation)" - this key has been broken for weeks
- **key1 ([KEY1])**: Had 23.11 DIEM on Mar 12, depleted to 0.188 DIEM by Mar 15

**Summary of the Venice issues:**

| Key | Status | Issue |
|-----|--------|-------|
| key1 ([KEY1]) | Exhausted DIEM | 0.188 DIEM remaining - can't complete requests |
| key2 ([KEY2]) | Auth failed | Key revoked/expired since Feb 26 |

**"Gateway failed" errors:** These are causing by the gateway config.patch calls I made without the `raw` parameter. The gateway tool requires `raw` for JSON patches.

**Root cause:** Both Venice API keys are non-functional:
1. key2 is completely revoked (401 on all requests since Feb 26)
2. key1 has exhausted DIEM_balance

**Action needed:** You need a new Venice API key with DIEM credits. The current fallback chain will skip Venice and use Morpheus/Ollama instead, which is working correctly.

Would you like me to:
1. Disable Venice in the fallback chain until you get a new key?
2. Document this in MEMORY.md for reference?

What issues did you find?
assistant: **Two issues found:**

---

### 1. "Gateway failed: raw required"
**Cause:** My `gateway config.patch` calls were missing the `raw` parameter. The gateway tool requires `raw` for JSON patches.
**Fixed:** Config patch succeeded on retry.

---

### 2. Venice API keys are dead

| Key | Status | Details |
|-----|--------|---------|
| key1 ([KEY1]) | DIEM exhausted | Down to 0.188 DIEM as of Mar 15 |
| key2 ([KEY2]) | Key revoked | 401 "Authentication failed" since Feb 26 |

**Evidence:** Both return 401 on completion requests. The models endpoint works (no auth required), but any actual inference fails.

**Current config:** `venice:default` points to key2 (the revoked one), `venice:key1` points to the exhausted key.

**Impact:** Venice fallback is dead. The chain falls through to Morpheus/Ollama, which is working fine.

**Action needed:** You need a new Venice API key with DIEM credits. Want me to disable Venice in the fallback chain until then?

Here is a new Venice API key with 98.99 daily DIEM credits that refresh everyday at 12 midnight UTC.
VENICE_KEY_REDACTED
assistant: Newkey works. Updating config:
assistant: Done. Venice is back online.

**Updated:**
- New API key active: `VENICE-INFERENCE-KEY-[KEY1]...`
- 98.99 DIEM daily (refreshes midnight UTC)
- Cleared 402 disabled state
- Gateway restarted

**Verified:** Tested completion with qwen3-4b - HTTP 200 ✅

Venice fallback now available for `venice/claude-opus-4-6` in the model chain.

Go ahead then and switch to venice/claude-opus-4-6.
I have tasks for that model specifically.
assistant: Done. Switched to **venice/claude-opus-4-6** with 98.99 DIEM daily.

**Current model config:**
- Primary: venice/claude-opus-4-6
- Fallbacks: morpheus/kimi-k2-thinking → ollama/qwen3.5:9b → venice/claude-opus-4-6

Ready for your tasks.
