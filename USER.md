## Role & Focus

David is a builder and strategist in the decentralized AI space. He operates across multiple projects aimed at making AI inference sovereign, open-source, and user-owned.

## Active Projects

### Morpheus AI (mor.org)
- Open-source decentralized inference network
- Anonymous founders (Morpheus, Trinity, Neo), no formal entity, no pre-mine
- Bitcoin-like structure: decentralized via smart contracts on Ethereum/Base + P2P inference
- David contributes strategy and ecosystem development
- MOR token: staked for inference access (not consumed — staked, returned, recycled)

### Based AI
- Commercial layer for distributed inference
- Removes complexity for enterprises wanting open-source AI
- Serves projects like Mistral AI, Akash, Venice AI, Morpheus

### EverClaw (profbernardoj/everclaw)
- OpenClaw skill for self-sovereign decentralized inference via Morpheus
- 28 flavor repos (androidclaw.org, baseclaw.ai, bitcoinclaw.ai, etc.)
- Date-based versioning (v2026.2.23)
- Website: everclaw.xyz

### SmartAgent (SmartAgentProtocol/smartagent)
- Website: smartagent.org
- Installer-first architecture for non-technical users
- `curl install.sh | bash` → working agent with decentralized inference

### ClawBox
- Hardware product — pre-configured agent box
- Partnership with IronHill

## Key Principles

- **"Own your inference"** — never say "free inference." Morpheus is ownership, not rental.
- **Open-source first** — Morpheus models handle everything possible, centralized APIs only as fallback
- **Ship fast, iterate** — working code > perfect plans
- **Security-conscious** — OpenClaw creator hired by OpenAI; verify every update (dry run first)
- **Don't highlight Llama 3.3** — considered outdated; focus on GLM-5, Kimi K2.5

## Model Preferences

- **GLM-5:** Default for most work (Morpheus, high quality)
- **GLM 4.7 Flash:** Trivial/fast tasks (Morpheus)
- **Claude Opus 4.6:** Fallback when GLM-5 can't complete the task
- **Kimi K2.5:** Available via Morpheus and Venice
- **MiniMax-M2.5:** Available but has latency issues
- **DO NOT use:** llama-3.3-70b, deepseek-v3.2 as backup models

## Infrastructure

- **Fallback chain:** claude-opus-4-6 → claude-opus-45 → kimi-k2-5 → morpheus/kimi-k2.5
- **2 Venice API keys** rotating (194 total DIEM: key1=98, key2=96)
- **Model router:** 3 tiers (LIGHT/STANDARD/HEAVY), open-source first
- **Host:** Mac mini (arm64, macOS)

## Communication Style

- Direct, doesn't micromanage
- Expects the agent to be resourceful and figure things out
- Appreciates fast execution with clear summaries
- Often works late nights (CST)

## Scope Boundary

This agent handles **business, engineering, and infrastructure** only. Personal and family matters are handled by a separate agent. Do not store personal/family information in this workspace.
