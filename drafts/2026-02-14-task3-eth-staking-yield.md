# Task 3: ETH Staking Yield Model for Morpheus — Research Brief

**Date:** 2026-02-14
**Status:** Complete
**For:** David Johnston

## Executive Summary

ETH staking currently yields ~3.3% APY (2.84% consensus + MEV/priority fees). This yield is the engine that powers Morpheus capital contracts — depositors redirect staking yield to the protocol and receive MOR emissions in return. With the v2 upgrade, Morpheus now also captures yield from USDC, USDT, and wBTC via Aave lending markets. The key insight: Morpheus capital providers earn MOR emissions that may significantly exceed the yield they contribute, making it an attractive proposition especially when MOR price appreciates.

## Current ETH Staking Yield (Feb 2026)

### Base Rates

| Metric | Value | Source |
|--------|-------|--------|
| Consensus layer APR | 2.84% | Dune/hildobby |
| Total APY (incl. MEV) | ~3.3% | DataWallet 2026 |
| Lido stETH APR | ~2.5% | StakingRewards |
| Lido fee | 10% of staking rewards | Lido docs |
| Net stETH yield to holder | ~2.9-3.0% | After Lido fee |

### Historical Trend

| Period | Approx APY | Notes |
|--------|-----------|-------|
| 2022 (post-Merge) | 4-5% | Initial high yields, fewer validators |
| 2023 | 3.5-5% | Validator growth, Shanghai unlocks |
| 2024 | 3-4% | Steady state, liquid staking dominance |
| 2025 | 3-3.5% | Rate compression as staking ratio grows |
| 2026 (current) | ~3.3% | 35.9M ETH staked (28.9% of supply) |

**Trend:** Declining over time as more ETH is staked (more validators = lower per-validator reward). Currently ~3.3% and likely to settle in the 2.5-3.5% range long-term.

### Key Network Stats (Jan 2026)

- **Total staked:** 35.86M ETH (28.9% of supply)
- **Active validators:** 1.1M+
- **Lido market share:** 24.2% (8.72M ETH)
- **Net staking flows:** Negative in late 2025/early 2026 (-600K ETH net outflows)
- **Validator exit queue:** Cleared (< 1 minute)
- **First ETF staking payouts:** Grayscale ETHE at $0.083/share

## How Morpheus Captures This Yield

### stETH Flow (Original v1)

1. User deposits stETH into Morpheus `DepositPool` on Ethereum
2. stETH rebases daily (~2.5-3% APY) — new stETH accrues to the pool
3. The **yield portion** (rebasing increase) is captured by the `Distributor`
4. Yield is converted to wstETH → bridged to Arbitrum via LayerZero
5. On Arbitrum: wstETH → swapped to MOR → added to protocol-owned liquidity
6. Capital providers receive MOR emissions proportional to their yield contribution

### Multi-Asset Flow (v2 — Sept 2025)

1. User deposits USDC, USDT, or wBTC into respective `DepositPool`
2. Assets are deposited into **Aave** lending markets
3. Aave generates yield (variable APY depending on utilization):
   - USDC: typically 2-5% APY on Aave
   - USDT: typically 2-5% APY on Aave  
   - wBTC: typically 0.1-1% APY on Aave
4. Chainlink oracles normalize all yields to USD-equivalent
5. MOR emissions distributed based on normalized yield contribution

## Yield Comparison: Morpheus vs Alternatives

### If You Just Stake ETH Directly

| Strategy | Annual Yield | Risk |
|----------|-------------|------|
| Solo staking | ~3.3% APY in ETH | Slashing, hardware |
| Lido stETH | ~2.5-3.0% APY | Smart contract, de-peg |
| Coinbase cbETH | ~2.8% APY | Counterparty |
| EigenLayer restaking | ~3.3% + points | Additional smart contract risk |

### If You Deposit stETH into Morpheus

| Component | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| ETH staking yield sacrificed | ~3% APY (goes to protocol) |
| MOR emissions received | Variable — depends on total deposits and MOR price |
| Principal risk | None (can withdraw, 7-day lock) |
| Additional risk | Smart contract risk (Morpheus contracts) |

### The MOR Emission Value Proposition

The critical question: **Are the MOR emissions worth more than the yield you give up?**

With MOR at ~$0.76 and 24% of daily emissions going to capital providers:
- Total MOR supply: 42M over 16 years
- Year 1 emissions (highest): ~14,400 MOR/day total → 3,456 MOR/day to capital providers
- Current daily value: 3,456 × $0.76 = ~$2,626/day to ALL capital providers
- Annualized: ~$958K/year distributed to capital providers

With 320,000 ETH having flowed through contracts (not all still deposited), the yield being contributed at ~3% on, say, $500M TVL would be ~$15M/year. So capital providers collectively contribute ~$15M in yield and receive ~$958K in MOR at current prices.

**At current MOR price (~$0.76), the trade is negative** — you give up more yield than you receive in MOR.

**However:** Early depositors got much higher MOR allocations (fewer depositors = bigger share). And if MOR appreciates (it was $16+ in 2024), the calculus changes dramatically. This is essentially a bet on Morpheus ecosystem growth.

## Risk Analysis

### Smart Contract Risk
- Morpheus contracts audited but complex (multi-chain: Ethereum → Arbitrum → Base)
- Dependency chain: Lido + Aave + Chainlink + LayerZero + Uniswap
- Each layer adds potential vulnerability surface

### stETH De-Peg Risk
- stETH historically traded at slight discount during market stress (2022: ~5% depeg)
- Currently trades ~1:1 with ETH
- Morpheus contracts don't protect against depeg losses

### MOR Price Risk
- MOR is volatile ($16+ → $0.76 over ~18 months)
- Emissions are in MOR — value depends entirely on MOR market price
- If MOR goes to zero, depositors lose their yield for nothing

### Yield Compression Risk
- ETH staking yields are declining as more ETH is staked
- More validators = lower per-validator reward
- Could compress to 2-2.5% range over next 1-2 years

### Liquidity Risk
- 7-day lock on stETH deposits (withdraw delay)
- No lock for USDC/USDT/wBTC pools (v2)

## Actionable Insights for David

1. **The yield-for-MOR trade is currently unfavorable at $0.76 MOR** — but this creates an opportunity narrative: "MOR is undervalued relative to the yield flowing into the protocol"
2. **Lock multipliers can significantly boost MOR earnings** — worth quantifying the exact multiplier schedule for documentation
3. **Multi-asset v2 expansion is the key growth lever** — USDC/USDT are easier for newcomers than stETH (no ETH exposure needed)
4. **Net negative staking flows on Ethereum** (late 2025) could reduce overall ETH staking yield competition — bullish for staking-based protocols
5. **Aave integration is battle-tested** — good trust signal for institutional capital providers
6. **The "no principal risk" framing is powerful** — emphasize this in all Morpheus capital marketing
7. **Consider creating a yield calculator** for Everclaw/SmartAgent that shows expected MOR emissions based on deposit amount and current TVL
